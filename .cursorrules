# Cursor Rules for Propulse Tracker

## Commit Message Conventions

When making commits, follow these rules:

1. **Use lowercase** - All commit messages should be in lowercase
2. **Present tense imperative** - Use verbs like "add", "fix", "update", "improve", "extend", "toggle", "remove", etc.
3. **Be concise and descriptive** - Clearly describe what the commit does
4. **No period at the end** - Do not end commit messages with a period
5. **Optional colon for detail** - Use a colon to add detail when helpful (e.g., "improve orderlist: show dots...")

### Examples

Good commit messages:
- `add undo/redo system to sample editor`
- `toggle volume and effect editing together with comma key`
- `extend undo/redo to orderlist and restore cursor position`
- `improve orderlist: show dots for unused entries and auto-expand on input`
- `fix soxr detection on macOS by preventing automatic disable`
- `update version to 0.10.0 and change URL to github`
- `remove windows-x86 and linux-x86 support`

Bad commit messages:
- `Added undo/redo system` (wrong tense, capitalized)
- `Fixed bug.` (capitalized, has period)
- `Update Makefile` (too vague)

## Code Style

- Follow Pascal/FreePascal conventions
- Use consistent indentation (spaces or tabs as per existing code)
- Comment complex logic
- Keep functions focused and reasonably sized

## File Organization

- Source files in `src/`
- Documentation in `docs/`
- Build artifacts should not be committed (see `.gitignore`)
- Libraries in `lib/` are committed despite `.gitignore` (as per project requirements)

## Atomic Commits

- Make atomic commits - one logical change per commit
- Split large changes into multiple commits when appropriate
- Group related changes together
- Follow the existing commit style in the repository

See `COMMIT_CONVENTIONS.md` for more details.
